# Super Galactic Age and Death Calculator.
_by David Mortkowitz_

*Description*
_A program that uses estimated solar years to calculate your age on different planets._

## Age Calculator Specs
_Calculator will use estimated solar years to calculate your local planetary age, based on your current Earth age. All ages are approximate, and use the Math.floor option to round to the most optimistic near integer. Additionally, it should give you an estimate for your time left based on worldwide averages, since local lifestyle will not be reflected on a distant planet. If you have surpassed the expected life expectancy, it should notify you of how many years you are passed expiry date. For example:_
```
| User Age | Planet  | Current Age | Time Remaining | or | Years Surpassed |
|----------|---------|-------------|----------------|----|-----------------|
| David    | Mercury |  138        |  159           |    |  0              |
| David    | Venus   |  54         |  62            |    |  0              |
| David    | Earth   |  33         |  38            |    |  0              |
| David    | Mars    |  18         |  21            |    |  0              |
| David    | Jupiter |  3          |  4             |    |  0              |
```
_These examples are calculated using my real age. If the user were old enough to surpass the expected worldwide average life expectancy of a man (71 years), it would show '0' in the time remaining column, and would begin counting in the Years Surpassed._)
